# MoviesCatalog

In this application, which I developed in accordance with the MVC architecture, I registered and logged into the system with Firebase Authentication. I created 3 different screens named Search WatchList and Favorite with Tab Bar Controller. I pulled data to the Search screen with API and sent the detail page movie number with segue. With this movie number, I reached the photo and content of the movie. Here you can add the movie to the database we have created in Firebase, for a watch list or a favorite list. Finally, I completed my operations by pulling the data for the watch screen and the favorite screen from the firebase.
